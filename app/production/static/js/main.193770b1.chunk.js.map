Don’t worry, the purpose of the quiz is to give us an idea of where we need to provide additional support, it’s not designed to catch you out.\\nFollowing the quiz, we’ll be scheduling a number of live sessions. These sessions are really important and designed to help us test our platform.  They will also help us test things like responsiveness and accuracy, and each of the live sessions will be time sensitive. For example, you may be given a number of hours or a couple of days to complete the training assignment.\\nMany of you have been writing in with encouragement and questions, and we love it!
