the Reading tab, you'll find a stack of materials we'd like you to review over the next few days.\\n\n\t\t\t\tYou'll see a Realfield Training Manual and a number of other great resources for you to review.\\nThe training will consist of a number elements that might start with a short quiz.\n\t\t\t\t\\nDon't worry, the purpose of the quiz is to give us an idea of where we need to provide additional support, it's not designed to catch you out.\\n\n\t\t\t\tFollowing the quiz, we'll be scheduling a number of live sessions. These sessions are really important and designed to help us test our platform.\\n\n\t\t\t\tThey will also help us test things like responsiveness and accuracy, and each of the live sessions will be time sensitive.\n\t\t\t\tFor example, you may be given a number of hours or a couple of days to complete the training assignment.\\n\n\t\t\t\tMany of you have been writing in with encouragement and questions, and we love it! If you have questions,\n\t\t\t\twant to offer feedback or need support, please continue to use the jobs@realfield.io address.\\n\n\t\t\t\tAsante sana and have an amazing
